1.  Tuple is exactly same sa List except it is a immutable.i.e once we creates Tuple object,we can not perform any changes in that object.
2.  Hence Tuple is Read only version of List.
3.  If our data is fixed and never changes then we should go for Tuple.
4.  Insertion Order is perserved.
5.  Duplicates are allowed.
6.  Heterogeneous object are allowed.
7.  We can perserve insertion order and we can differentiate duplicate objects by using index.Hence index will play important role in Tuple also.
8.  Tuple support both +ve and -ve index.
            +ve -> forward direction ( Left to Right )
            -ve -> backward direction ( Right to Left )
9.  We can represent Tuple element within paraenthesis and with comma seperator .
10  Paraenthesis are optional but recommendated to use .


NOTE : 
  We have to take special care about single valued tuple.compulsary the value should ends with comma,otherwise it is not treated as tuple.



Accessing Elements of Tuple :
      1. By using index
      2. By using slice operator 


Mathematical operators for Tuple : 
    1. + -> concatenation 
    2. * -> Repetition  


Important Functions of Tuple : 
    1. len()
    2. count()
    3. index()
    4. sorted()
    5. min() and max()
    6. cmp() -> Only  Python 2 available


        index() :
          Returns index of first occurrance of the given element.
          If the specified element is not available then we will get ValueError.

        cmp() :
          It compares the elements of both tuples 
          If both tuples are equal then returns 0. ***********************************
          If the first tuple is less than second tuple then it returns -1.   *********
          If the first tuple is greater than second tuple then it returns +1. ********
        

        NOTE :
           cmp() Functions is available only Python 2 but not in Python 3.


Tuple Packing and Unpacking :
      We can create a tuple by Packing a group of variables .
      a = 10
      b = 20
      c = 30
      d = 40
      t = a,b,c,d 
      print(t)

      NOTE :
         Here a,b,c,d are packed into a Tuple t . This is nothing but Tuple Packing.
         Tuple Unpacking is the reverse process of Tuple Packing.
         We can unpack a Tuple and resign its values to different variables.

         At the time of tuple Unpacking the number of variables and number of values should be same ,otherwise we will get ValueError.

         t = (10,20,30,40) 
         a,b,c = t -> ValueError .


Tuple Comprehension :
   
    Tuple Comprehension is not support by Python. ************************
    t = (  x**2 for x in range(1,11))
    Here we are not getting tuple object and we are getting generator object.




    ********************* LIST vs TUPLE *************************************


    List objects can not used as keys for Dictionaries because keys should be Hashable and immutable .
    Tuple object can be used as keys for Dictionaries because keys should be Hashable and immutable .
